"There once was a little boy named Nathan from Iowa. He was raised on corn and plaid shirts.  He had the heart of the midwest running through his viens.  He had a funny way of talking and would say things like, "Alls I know." He could be sassy but overall was a good person. He is in fact wearing a plaid shirt today. His humor was unique.  Probably from all the corn he ate as a child.  He had particular eating habits as well.  He loved very plain food"
